# Codar.me - Desenvolvendo Software de Verdade 

Codar.me is an educational brazilian company localted in the city of Florian√≥polis in the state of Santa Catarina. I recently bought a course from them, called "Desenvolvendo Software de Verdade", which will teach the development of a full stack application from web and mobile, using technologies such as:

* Javascript
* React e React Native
* NodeJS
* Docker
* Jest e React Testing Library
* Some more...

More information can be found here (PT-BR): https://codar.me/inscricoes.

The interesting part about this course is that it is not designed just to teach the technologies. The main goal of the course is to develop a real application, passing through the design of the windows of the application, design patterns, best practices, discussions on which libraries and dependencies to add to our application, making projects decisions, error handling and so on.
