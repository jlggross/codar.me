NodeJS Intro Course

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Class 01: Configuration and running first script with node.js

* Install a terminal for Windows:
	Fluent Terminal: https://github.com/felixse/FluentTerminal
	Scoop package manager https://github.com/lukesampson/scoop

* Steps to execute: 
1. Open terminal

2. Check node.js version: 
> node -v

3. Create index.js file. Create a function, run it and print the return with console.log()

4. In the terminal, go to the file's folder and run the command below to execute the javascript file
> node index.js

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Class 02 - Modules - CommonJS

* Modules is a way to break our code into separate files 

* We have two ways to create modules:
1. CommonJS
  * It is not the official way of creating modules, but it's been used before
	ESM was created
	* We create a separate file for our function and use the 'module' object from 
	node.js with the 'export' method to export the function. This can only export 
	one function.
		* If we want to export more function then we have to create and object 
		containing the functions and export the object
	* In the file we want to use the exported function we just use the 'require'
	method
2. ESM - ES Modules - EcmaScript Modules
	* EcmaScript is the oficial JavaScript programming language name.
	* ESM is the official way to implement modules in JavaScript. 
	* You can find many references to ESM in the JavaScript documentation.
	* Is the more recent approach, coming since 2015.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Class 03 - Modules - ESM

* First of all we have to create a file called 'package.json' and insert:

{
  "type": "module"
}

This is needed so node can recognize our javaScript files as modules, allowing
them to import other modules

* We can also re-export all the function of a .js file

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Class 04 - Package Manager

* By default node.js comes with npm (Node Package Manager) package manager
installed
* We can check the version of npm with:

> npm -v

* Website www.npmjs.com to check available packages to download/install

* Another package manager is yarn (Yarn Package Manager)
	* yarn was created to solve some issues related to npm
	* Installing yarn https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started
	* yarn also uses package.json for the project's configuration

* yarn  to create package.json file:
> yarn init
	* name: choose name (we chose 'modules')
	* version: choose version (we chose 0.0.0)
	* description: write description
	* entry point: which file is the first to run when we execute the application
	* private: true

* to publish the package in the npm's website we can run. If 'private' is set to 
'true' than the package will not be published.
> npm publish

* To add dependencies to our package we can run:
> yarn add --dev @codar/eslint-plugin
	* This add dev dependencies to our project. It does not add code to the project. Instead 
	it adds resources to help the project's development.
	* It will create a yarn.lock file
	* This will also add a new line in the package.json file
> yarn add react
	* This add software/package dependencies which are a necessity to development the project


* To install the project's dependencies we just run:
> yarn install

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Class 05 - Creating a NPM account, Publishing a package

1. We create an account in NPM: https://www.npmjs.com/signup

2. Login to npm
> npm login

3. Check project name on npm website
	* First we have to check if the package name exists
	* Go to https://www.npmjs.com/package/<package name>
	* If the page you try to access does not exist, than you can create a package with that name to publish

4. We create a package with yarn
	* Enter via terminal to the folder you want to create the package
	* Initiate the package
	> yarn init
		* name: resume-jlggross
		* version: 0.1.0
		* description: João Gross Resume
		* entry point: index.js
		* author: João Gross 
		* license: MIT
		* private: 

5. We add 'module.exports = "João Gross"' to our index.js file

6. We publish the package in the NPM website
> npm publish

7. Check package in https://www.npmjs.com/package/resume-jlggross

8. Now we make modifications on our package and try to publish again
	* This yields an error because we changed the package, so we have to publish
	a new version.

9. Change package version
	* Open file 'package.json' and alter the version to 0.2.0
	* Now we can publish with 'npm publish'
	* We can also check the new version at https://www.npmjs.com/package/resume-jlggross

10. At https://www.npmjs.com/package/resume-jlggross run 'Try on RunKit'

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Class 06 - Scoped Packages

* Go to you npm profile page.
* You can see a 'Packages' tab and an 'Organizations' tab.
* The 'Organizations' tab is related to scoped packages
	* https://www.npmjs.com/package/@codar/eslint-plugin is an example of scoped package
	* The URL of these kinds of packages has the organization identified with an '@',
	in the case above it is '@codar'. The package name is 'eslint-plugin'.

1. Create and Organization. It will be 'jlggross-projects' in our case

2. Open file 'package.json' and alter the package name:

"name": "resume-jlggross" => "name": "@jlggross-projects/resume-jlggross"

3. Also configure the package to be public:

"publishConfig": {
    "access": "public"
  }

4. Login to npm and publish the package
> npm login
> npm publish

5. Check package online https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jlggross-projects/resume-jlggross

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Class 07 - Install Dependencies

* To install a package we use:
> yarn add package-name
> yarn add resume-jlggross
	* yarn checks the package's name in the npm listing and add the dependency to
	the package.json file
	* When we add a package to our project yarn creates a node_modules folder
	and download the package

* To install a specific version of the package:
> yarn add package-name@version
> yarn add resume-jlggross@0.1.0

* To use the package we have to refer to the module in a js file:
const about = require("resume-jlggross")
	* Here we created a javascript file named resume.js

* Than we can run resume.js file with node:
> node resume.js

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Class 08 - HTTP Protocol (Theory)

* Composed of 3 parts:
	* Address
	* Headers
	* Body : body of the requisition

* We have a request and then a response.
	* Request and response, both work with the HTTP protocol.

* Address: We use URL (Universal Resource Locator)
	* Full URL: http://www.google.com/search?q=codarme
	* URL structure:		
		* Protocol: http://
		* Host: www.google.com
			* Subdomain (optional): www
			* Unique identifier inside a TLD, also called domain: google
			* TLD (Top Level Domain): .com
		* Resource: /search
			* This is the resource we want to access in the server
		* Query string: ?q=codarme
			* The parameters to the 
			* Used to filter data in the back-end

* Header: Used to provide information for requests e responses. They
give context to the request.
	* Content type: Specify the type of content
	* Origin: URL origin
	* Authorization: Tell who is logged in the application

* Body: Totally related to the header's content type. The content of 
the body is also called payload.
	* Exists only for PUT and POST requests
	* Does not exist for GET and DELETE requests
		* The GET response has a body (payload)

* HTTP Protocol Methods (or Verbs)
	* GET: Get resources
	* POST: Create resources
	* PUT: Alter resources
	* DELETE: Remove resources
	* Others

* Response : Status Code
	* Contains the status code plus the text of that status code
	* With this information we can know how the request ended.
	* Some Status Code:
		* 404 : Not found
		* 100 - 199 : Information codes
		* 200 : Ok
		* 200 - 299 : Success codes
		* 300 - 399 : Redirect codes
		* 301 : Permanent redirect
		* 400 - 499 : Client request error codes. The client has to deal with the error.
		* 500 - 599 : Server request error codes. The server has to deal with the error.

Class 08 - HTTP Protocol (Practice)

Creating our first node.js server/API

* The http package comes installed by default with node.js
* We define our server with callback and port to listen
