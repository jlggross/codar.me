To be able to import and export modules in javascript we need to run a local server

One alternative is to open the VSCode terminal and navigate to the file's folder, then run:

> python3 -m http.server 8000

Than, to execute the html file, we just have to go to the browser:

http://localhost:8000/<file>.html
